This is an addition to LPJ-GUESS 4.0

This defines a new input param "file_dist" that defines a disturbance probability
per year. Implementation followed that of file_co2, hence error messages will resemble
those of co2. 

Note: in Vanilla a disturbance intervall is given, that is transoformed
to a disturbance probability 1/intervall internally. Here disturbance probability
is given directly. The reason for this that is allows to switch disturbance off
in certain time intervall by inputing porbability 0. For intervall is is much less
convenient, one would need to input interval -> inf.
