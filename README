this is an addition to LPJ-GUESS 4.0

This uses the vegstruct output by joerg steinkamp (https://github.com/joergsteinkamp/newOutputModule4LPJGUESS)
providing output in the individual level.
It is adapted to be  compatible with LPJ-GUES 4.0. and cmass is added as a variable. 

It also adds a second output module in the same style that gives output on the
patch level.

Note: you will find ghost trees with cmass = 0 and also small deviations from
commonoutput. This due to rounding error.
