Addition to LPJ-GUESS 4.0

This adds an external parameter called "randomseed" which defines the seed for
random number generation. In default LPJ-GUESS is is hardcoded to 12345678 twice:
inside the gridcell member function and inside the stand member function.
In both this instances seed is to initiated with "randomseed" instead.
